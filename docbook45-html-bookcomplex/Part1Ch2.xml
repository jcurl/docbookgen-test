    <title>Advanced Format and Windows Server 2003</title>

    <para>The server uses Advanced Format drives for the data storage, where
    the Virtual Machines are kept. There are two types of 4k drives:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>512: 512-byte emulation mode. The drive presents itself as a
        legacy 512-byte sectored drive at the firmware level. Thus addresses
        is in units of 512 bytes (LBA 2048 is the first 1MB boundary,
        <emphasis>2048 x 512 bytes</emphasis> is 1024kB or 1MB.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>4kn: The drive uses native 4k sectors. Most operating systems as
        of today (including VMWare vSphere ESXi 5.0) do not support these
        drives.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The hardware installed is the WD20EARX which Advanced Format using
    512e. Microsoft do not support Advanced Format drives for operating
    systems Windows Server 2003, Windows XP or earlier. This does not imply
    that software will not work on these drives. There are however known
    performance degredations unless one is prepared to invest more time in
    configuring the system.</para>

    <para>The default configuration for Windows Server 2003 (and Windows XP)
    is to install the first partition at an LBA of 63. This is not aligned
    with the 4k sectors of the Advanced Format drives. An LBA of 63 on a 512e
    AF-drive aligns to 31.5kB, which is not a multiple of 4kB.</para>

    <para>Thus for the older operating systems, it is required to repartition
    the virtual images so that partitions begin on a 1MB boundary (LBA
    2048).</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Advanced Format Implementation</title>

    <para>There is a detailed discussion about <ulink
    url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Format">Advanced Format</ulink>
    on Wikipedia. Advanced Format drives are an issue for the performance of
    systems as for older operating systems, such as Windows XP and Windows
    Server 2003, partitions are not aligned with the sectors on the
    drive.</para>

    <para>An Advanced Format drive, such as the Western Digital WD20EARX, has
    4k sectors physically on the platters. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003
    generally define cluster sizes within their filesystem to be also 4k.
    </para>

    <para>The performance loss comes about by the 4k clusters not aligning
    exactly with the 4k sectors on the drive. This is due to the first LBA of
    the partitions for the filesystems being LBA 63. This implies the first
    cluster has an offset of 31.5kb.</para>

    <figure id="fig.wxp_partition_misalignment">
      <title>Sector Misalignment</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="figures/AF_Misalignment.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>From <xref linkend="fig.wxp_partition_misalignment"/>, we see that a
    LBA of 63-70 is physical sectors 6-7. When reading a 4k cluster from the
    filesystem, two physical sectors must be read instead of one. For
    streaming data, this is unlikely to cause an issue. For reading random
    data, we begin to see some inefficiencies.</para>

    <para>When writing a single 4k cluster, the drive actually has to read two
    4k sectors, modify the data and write the two physical sectors back to
    disk. Again, when writing data continuously, the drive can probably
    optimise itself so that there are fewer read operations. But as we begin
    to read/write random data, we see that the write operations receive the
    biggest performance hit.</para>

    <para>For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, we can work around this by
    organising the partitions such that the clusters in the filesystem are
    aligned with the sectors on the drive. This implies reading a single
    cluster will read only one sector (less pollution in the drive cache) and
    writing a 4k cluster saves time by not having to read both sectors, wait
    for the spindle of the drive to relocate the sectors before writing
    again.</para>

    <para>For Windows Home Server (version 1), Microsoft recommend against
    using the new Advanced Format Drives. See <ulink
    url="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2385637/en-us">Microsoft
    Knowledgebase Article 2385637</ulink>.</para>

    <para>When observing the results in <xref linkend="table.perftest2"/>, we
    see that the performance for sequential reads and writes are lower than we
    might expect. There was a difference in the tests for aligned and
    unaligned, such that the location of the VMDK is at a significantly
    different location on the disk. The unaligned tests had two other virtual
    machines causing an offset of about 200GB into the drive. The higher
    results from the aligned partition are more similar to the tests done for
    unaligned. </para>

    <para>Thus we can see that alignment has a big influence in performance.
    We also see for the WD20EARX drives that the position on the disk also has
    an impact.</para>

    <para>We see that there is a visible benefit, to both the installation
    time and the performance measurements made, when the partitions are
    correctly aligned. The random read/writes benefit the most, as one would
    expect.</para>
